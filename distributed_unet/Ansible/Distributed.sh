# We assume that there has been a conda environment setup named 'tf'.
# To create a new conda environment:
# conda create -n tf -c intel python=2 pip numpy
# source activate tf
# pip install https://anaconda.org/intel/tensorflow/1.4.0/download/tensorflow-1.4.0-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl
# pip install keras
# You'll also need whatever other packages your script relies on (e.g. opencv, simpleITK, h5py)
# pip install h5py opencv-python simpleITK tqdm

# Activate the correct Tensorflow environment (conda)
source activate tf
cd $1
# Run the distributed tensorflow
# We flush messages immediately rather than buffering them.
# All messages go to the local training.log file
stdbuf -oL python $1main.py --ip=$2 --is_sync=1 > $1training.log
